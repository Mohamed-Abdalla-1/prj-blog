# Next Blog

This blog was built using Next.js, React, and Markdown. It serves as a platform to share my thoughts on web development, technology, and more.

## Features

- Fetch blog posts from Markdown files 
- Tagging and categories for posts
- Author info and bio
- Pagination 
- Search posts by title or tag
- Responsive design

## Tools & Techniques

- Next.js - SSR, file-based routing, API routes
- React - Components, hooks, context API
- markdown-it - Markdown parsing 
- CSS Modules - Component-scoped styling
- Deployed on Vercel

## Running Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/user/prj-blog
cd blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Scaling Up

Future iterations could integrate a CMS like Contentful or use a database to manage posts. But overall this project served as a great way to sharpen React skills and learn Next fundamentals.
